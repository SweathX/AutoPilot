## Features

- üöó **Multiple Autonomous Vehicles** - 3 cars with different colors/speeds navigating independently
- üõ£Ô∏è **Complex Circuit Design** - Customizable closed-loop track with multiple curves
- üß≠ **Proportional Control System** - PID-inspired steering adjustment mechanism
- üì° **Virtual Distance Sensors** - Visualized sensor beams for path detection
- üåà **Dynamic Visualization** - Smooth animations with gradient background

## How It Works

### Sensor System

Each car uses a front-mounted virtual sensor that:

1. Projects 40px ahead of vehicle
2. Measures distance to nearest track edge
3. Calculates deviation from ideal path

### Control Mechanism

The navigation system implements:

- **P (Proportional) Control**:

steering_angle = -Kp \* sensor_error

- `Kp`: Proportional gain constant (0.005)
- `sensor_error`: Signed distance from path (negative=left, positive=right)

### Path Following

1. Vector projection calculates nearest point on track
2. Cross product determines deviation direction
3. Continuous steering adjustments maintain optimal path
